# 🌞 Solar Power Generation Prediction (Frontend)

🚀 Launched on **Product Hunt** built during a **36-hour Hackathon**!  
This is a **Next.js frontend application** that connects with a Python backend API to predict **solar power generation** and help users explore clean energy potential.  

It’s not just code it’s my way of showing how tech + sustainability can work hand-in-hand ⚡☀️

## ✨ What it does

- **Simple & Intuitive Interface**  
  Input your location, panel details, and date range → get instant solar predictions.

- **API-Powered Insights**  
  Fetches data from the backend, processes it, and returns a **detailed solar analysis report**.

- **Smart Visualization**  
  Displays:
  - Solar potential & estimated savings.
  - Charts & metrics on weather impact.
  - Optimal panel setup.
  - Financial projections for cost vs. savings.

- **Responsive Design**  
  Built with **Next.js**, works smoothly across desktop & mobile.

## 🛠️ How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/darshitdudhaiya/Solar-Power-Generation-Prediction
cd Solar-Power-Generation-Prediction
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Configure API endpoint

Ensure your application knows the URL of the backend API.
Set this in a `.env.local` file:

```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### 4. Run the application

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The frontend will be accessible at 👉 http://localhost:3000

### 📡 API Usage

1. Start the backend API server as described in its README.
2. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
3. Fill out the form with the desired solar analysis parameters.
4. Click the "Analyze" button to send the request to the backend and view the generated report.

### Why Product Hunt?

- Built in a Hackathon 🕒 (36 hrs of no-sleep coding).
- Hosted on free hosting (so APIs may take a little patience 🙏).
- Focused on real-world sustainability impact 🌍.

If you like projects that mix tech + green energy, I’d love your support 💛.
